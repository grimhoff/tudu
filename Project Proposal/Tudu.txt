My goal is to create a website for working on a computer. Typically, when
I'm doing my school work or any sort of computer related task I have several
different tabs and applications going: background music, a timer, and I've got
my analog sticky notes with what I have to do. BUT what if they were all in one 
place? Well i'm attemping to do exactly that with TUDU.

Users will be able to submit a task which consists of: name, priority, notes, 
due date, and category. Upon opening to the homepage the user will be greeted 
with their in-progress tasks that can be sorted by priority, category, and due date.
Tasks can be edited, viewed (focused on), and completed (deleted)

If you're like me, you may look at a list and think "where do I even start??", 
well lucky for you there will be a "random task" button that will choose from the
active users in-progress tasks.

Upon choosing a task to focus on the user is taken to a page with the title and
notes of the app. This page will have a timer that they can set (and will alert
the user when it counts all the way down to 0) and music player that can play
chill lofi studying music. Upon completing a task, the user will be redirected to
the homepage and the task will be deleted. I'm hoping to figure out a way to show
how many tasks they have completed on the homepage as well.
